OOP Approach 


1- File Structure 

(Shared Helper (Helper,Generic,Extension) , Custom(Entites/Interfaces/Services))

 Entites ---> to Represent System Classes  (Object Template)  (System Compnent )
 Contract ---> to Represent Blue Print of the Provided Service on the system  (Abstract Method)
 Service ----> to Hold the real services Implementation 

 ---- (Extentions/Generic/Helper )Helper 


2- on Entites Folder Add The system Class

3- on each class inside Entites Folder Add Class Proprty 

4- Divide the implement Classes into Actor and object then detemine the relationship 

5-     Divide  The Opertions for Either
          1- Each Actor (look at each actor and list all possible operation in his contract class)
          2- Each Class (look at each class in the system and list all possible CRUD Operation)
          3- Each Services (look at ther service category on the system (RentalRequest,SignContract,EndRental))
